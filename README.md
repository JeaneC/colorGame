# colorGame
__Description__: A game that tests your RGB skills. Can you recognize an RGB color given just its individual Red, Green, and Blue values?


__Version 1.05?__
- I unforunately don't remember the history of my commits too well, since I created this app a while ago
- This update includes an executable file that was packaged with Electron (pretty awesome...),
